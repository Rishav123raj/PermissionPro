# PermissionPro : Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System
# Project Overview
PermissionPro is a robust implementation of Authentication, Authorization, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for modern web applications. 
This system ensures secure user management by verifying identity, assigning roles, and restricting access based on permissions.
# Core Features
# Authentication
1.Secure user registration and login.
2. Password hashing using industry standards (e.g., BCrypt).
3. Session management using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
# Authorization
1. Role-based access restrictions (e.g., Admin, User, Moderator).
2. Endpoint protection based on user roles.
# RBAC Implementation
1. Flexible role and permission management.
2. Secure route guards to prevent unauthorized access.
# Additional Features
1. Password recovery via email service.
2. Comprehensive error handling and exception management.
3. Modular and extensible architecture for future enhancements.
# Technologies Used
1. Backend: Spring Boot, Java
2. Security: JWT, BCrypt
3. Database: PostgreSQL (or any preferred RDBMS)
4. Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or placeholder for integration)
5. Configuration Management: Maven
6. Deployment: Docker (optional)

# Steps to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository:
    - git clone https://github.com/Rishav123raj/PermissionPro
    - cd permissionpro
2. Configure the database:
    - Update application.properties with your database details:
    - spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/permissionpro
    - spring.datasource.username=<your-username>
    - spring.datasource.password=<your-password>
    - spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
3. Run the application:
    - mvn spring-boot:run
# API Endpoints
# Authentication
- POST /auth/register: Register a new user.
- POST /auth/login: Login and receive a JWT token.
- POST /auth/logout: Log out the user.
# Profile
- GET /profile: Get the current user's profile.
- PUT /profile/update: Update profile information.
# Role Management
- GET /roles: List all roles.
- POST /roles: Add a new role (Admin only).
- DELETE /roles/{id}: Remove a role (Admin only).
# Protected Resources
- GET /admin/dashboard: Admin-only access.
- GET /user/home: Access restricted to regular users.
# RBAC Implementation
# Role Model:
- Roles are predefined and stored in the database.
- Each role has a set of permissions tied to it.
# JWT Integration:
- JWT tokens are issued on successful login.
- Tokens include user details and roles, enabling role-based validation.
# Endpoint Protection:
- Security filters validate tokens and user roles before granting access to endpoints.
- Security Best Practices
- Passwords are hashed using BCrypt.
- JWT tokens are signed and verified using a secret key.
- API responses are secured to avoid sensitive data leaks.
- CSRF and CORS configurations are handled via SecurityConfiguration.
# Future Enhancements
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- User activity monitoring and logging.
- Dynamic role and permission assignment via admin interface.
